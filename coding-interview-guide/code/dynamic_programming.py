Dynamic Programming

Placeholder - Details to be added

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive solutions by storing results of
subproblems to avoid recomputation.

Two approaches:
- Memoization (top-down): Cache results as you compute
- Tabulation (bottom-up): Build table from base cases

Key properties:
- Overlapping subproblems
- Optimal substructure

Time: Typically O(n) or O(n²) instead of exponential
Space: O(n) or O(n²) for memo/table
