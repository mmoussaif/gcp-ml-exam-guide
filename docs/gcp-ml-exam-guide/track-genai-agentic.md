## Track B: GenAI & Agentic AI (Exam + Practical)

This track covers **LLMs, RAG, agents, evaluation, and production AgentOps/LLMOps**.  
Use it once you’re comfortable with Track A basics (or if your focus is GenAI).

### What you should get from this track

- Understand transformer basics (tokenization/attention/MoE) at the right depth for engineers
- Choose prompting/RAG/tuning based on requirements (cost, latency, correctness)
- Design agent systems (tools, memory, sessions, multi-agent patterns)
- Operate GenAI in production (security, guardrails, eval/observability, traffic)
- Navigate the ecosystem across GCP/AWS/Azure and open-source frameworks
