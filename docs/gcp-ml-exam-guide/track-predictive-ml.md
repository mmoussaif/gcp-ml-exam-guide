## Track A: Predictive ML (Exam Core)

This track is classic ML engineering: **data → training → deployment → monitoring**.  
It deliberately avoids GenAI/agentic patterns unless they’re explicitly labeled.

### What you should get from this track

- Build the right model (supervised/unsupervised/deep learning basics)
- Use TensorFlow tooling effectively
- Pick the right Google Cloud service for training/serving/monitoring
- Design pipelines and MLOps systems that are reliable and reproducible
- Understand infra tradeoffs: cost, hardware, security, and serving
