## Google Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer — Exam Prep Guide (Markdown)

This folder contains a **source-faithful** Markdown conversion of the study guide content you provided (originally authored as a `docx` generator script).

### Table of contents

- **Part I**: [`part-1-ml-fundamentals.md`](./part-1-ml-fundamentals.md)
- **Part II**: [`part-2-tensorflow-ecosystem.md`](./part-2-tensorflow-ecosystem.md)
- **Part III**: [`part-3-gcp-ml-services.md`](./part-3-gcp-ml-services.md)
- **Part IV**: [`part-4-pipelines-and-architecture.md`](./part-4-pipelines-and-architecture.md)
- **Part V**: [`part-5-infrastructure-and-deployment.md`](./part-5-infrastructure-and-deployment.md)
- **Part VI**: [`part-6-generative-ai.md`](./part-6-generative-ai.md)
- **Part VII**: [`part-7-ai-tools-and-frameworks.md`](./part-7-ai-tools-and-frameworks.md)
- **Quick Reference + Common Exam Traps**: [`quick-reference.md`](./quick-reference.md)
- **BigQuery SQL Cheat Sheet**: [`bigquery-sql-cheat-sheet.md`](./bigquery-sql-cheat-sheet.md)
- **Google AI News & Updates**: [`google-ai-news.md`](./google-ai-news.md)

**Note on Part VII:** Part VII is **not** part of the official Professional Machine Learning Engineer exam guide/scope. It's included as an author-curated "tooling + ecosystem" reference to capture additional details and practical knowledge.

**Note on News:** The `google-ai-news.md` file tracks recent Google AI announcements from [blog.google](https://blog.google/) and [Innovation & AI](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/). Not exam content — just for staying current with the ecosystem.

### Web verification note (current blocker)

I attempted to use automated web search to validate technical claims, but the tool output is currently **not returning real web results** (it echoes conversation text instead). Until that is fixed, this repo includes a short checklist of the highest-impact claims to verify manually, with official doc starting points in `quick-reference.md`.

### Disclaimer + contributions

- **Disclaimer**: This guide is compiled from reading and many different resources. **Always double-check facts** against official documentation.
